Welcome!

I am a Research Associate in the [Systems and Algorithms Laboratory
(SysAL)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/systems-algorithms-design-lab/), Dyson
School of Design and Engineering at Imperial College London. I also work within
the [Care Research & Technology (CR&T) Centre at UK Dementia Research Institute
(DRI)](https://ukdri.ac.uk/centres/care-research-technology) to help design and
implement edge-based intelligent systems for in-home healthcare.

I am broadly interested in user-centric systems powered by personal data and
privacy protection. My current focus is designing and implementing edge-based
machine-learning systems for smart healthcare in a privacy-preserving fashion
through federated learning.
