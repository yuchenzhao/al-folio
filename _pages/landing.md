Welcome!

I am a Research Associate in the [Systems and Algorithms Laboratory
(SysAL)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/systems-algorithms-design-lab/) in the Dyson
School of Design and Engineering at Imperial College London. I also work within
the [Care Research & Technology (CR&T)
Centre](https://ukdri.ac.uk/centres/care-research-technology) at UK Dementia
Research Institute (DRI) to help design and implement edge-based in-home
healthcare.

I am broadly interested in user-centric systems powered by personal data and
privacy protection in such systems. My current focus is to design and
implement edge-based intelligent systems for smart healthcare in a
privacy-preserving fashion through federated learning.
